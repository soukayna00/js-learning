JSON is Like XML Because
Both JSON and XML are "self describing" (human readable)
Both JSON and XML are hierarchical (values within values)
Both JSON and XML can be parsed and used by lots of programming languages
Both JSON and XML can be fetched with an XMLHttpRequest



JSON doesn't use end tag
JSON is shorter
JSON is quicker to read and write
JSON can use arrays
 XML has to be parsed with an XML parser. JSON can be parsed by a standard JavaScript function.
