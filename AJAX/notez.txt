1 )AJAX is a misleading name. AJAX applications might use XML to transport data, but it is equally common to transport data as plain text or JSON text.
A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)



2) The HTML page contains a <div> section and a <button>.

3 )The <div> section is used to display information from a server.

The <button> calls a function (if it is clicked).

The function requests data from a web server and displays it:




1. An event occurs in a web page (the page is loaded, a button is clicked)
2. An XMLHttpRequest object is created by JavaScript
3. The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request to a web server
4. The server processes the request
5. The server sends a response back to the web page
6. The response is read by JavaScript
7. Proper action (like page update) is performed by JavaScript


The keystone of AJAX is the XMLHttpRequest object.

Create an XMLHttpRequest object
Define a callback function
Open the XMLHttpRequest object
Send a Request to a server


<In this case, the callback function should contain the code to execute when the response is ready.>
